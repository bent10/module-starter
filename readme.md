- **Auto updates changelog:** Automates the process of updating the changelog file, making it easier to track project changes.

## Install

To start a new project using Module Starter, you can either **click the "Use this template"** button on GitHub or manually clone the repository. After cloning, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

Alternatively, you can use the `npx degit` command to clone the template into a new project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npx degit "bent10/module-starter" my-project
cd my-project
npm i
```

## Available Commands

Use the following commands in the project directory:

- `npm start`: Alias for `npm run dev`.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the development build and watches for changes.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project using Vite and runs the type checking.
- `npm test`: Runs tests with the `vitest` command, using the UI.
- `npm run coverage`: Runs tests with the `vitest` command and generates code coverage.
- `npm run types`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to emit declaration files (`*.d.ts`) to the `./dist` directory. Resolves TypeScript path aliases using `resolve-tspaths`.
- `npm run lint`: Runs the TypeScript compiler with `--noEmit` flag to perform type checking and runs ESLint to lint the project.
- `npm run format`: Runs Prettier to format the project files.

Feel free to use these commands according to your development needs.
